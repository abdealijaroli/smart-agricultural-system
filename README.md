# smart-agricultural-system
We aim to produce a solution for easy crop prediction taking into consideration multiple factors like temperature, rain, humidity and location and making it a very feasible and an easy tool for the farmers to make better decisions about planting and to make this possible for free requiring no maintenance and to provide the mobile friendly solutions as well.
-- The proposed project provides a solution for Smart Agriculture by monitoring the agricultural field which can assist the farmers in increasing productivity to a great extent. 
-- Weather forecast data obtained from IMD (Indian Metrological Department) such as temperature and rainfall and soil parameters repository gives insight into which crops are suitable to be cultivated in a particular area.
-- This system is, in form of a website, which uses Machine Learning techniques in order to predict the most producible crop in the current weather and soil conditions. 
-- The proposed system will integrate the data obtained from soil, crop repository, weather conditions and by applying machine learning algorithm: Multiple Linear Regression, a prediction of most suitable crops according to current environmental conditions is made.
